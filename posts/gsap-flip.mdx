In this article, we'll look at a cool plugin from **GSAP** called **Flip**.
(_This is a free plugin, at the time of this article, so you should be able to follow along._)

**GSAP Flip** is all about seamlessly transitioning elements in your web page between two different states.
It makes transitions that would be very difficult to accomplish a whole lot easier to pull off!

The term **Flip** is derived from an acronym, coined by developer Paul Lewis.
The acronym stands for
**first-last-invert-play**

## Flip Examples

Here's an example of the **Flip** plug-in in action from a [codepen](https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/full/ExwXaKy) by Chris Coyier.

Here we have a mini gallery. You'll see a large featured image on top and two smaller images on the bottom.

When one of the bottom images is clicked, it seamlessly transitions to become the larger featured image.

Here's another **Flip** example from a [codepen](https://codepen.io/hexagoncircle/full/RwLQLop) by Ryan Mulligan.
Notice that clicking on a box results in it getting moved out of its containing box down to the shopping cart in the lower right.

The **Flip** plugin enables us to create these types of seamless transitions.

## Installing Flip

Let's get started by installing the **Flip** plugin and **GSAP** core.

Go to the [GSAP installation page](https://greensock.com/docs/v3/Installation?checked=core,flip)
and find the **GSAP 3 Install Helper**(note: **GSAP** is at version 3 at the time of this article).

Under the **CDN Extra Plugins** tab, make sure that **Flip** is checked.
Now, find the two necessary script tags below in the "Browser code" section.
(_The first one is the **GSAP** core library. The second one is for the **Flip** plugin_).

Click on the "COPY CODE" button.
Then, you can paste these script tags into your HTML file.
(_generally, you'd want to paste them before the closing <Syntax>body</Syntax> tag_)

## Let's Write Some Code!

Let's create an example where we re-parent a div into another <Syntax>div</Syntax>(rotated 30 degrees) in response to a click event.

Here's how the final result will look:

<Image
  src="./images/blog/gsap-flip/reparent_lg.gif"
  width={720}
  height={405}
  layout="responsive"
  alt="A div being re-parented into another div using GSAP Flip"
/>

<br />
<br />
<br />

In an HTML file, let's begin by creating two <Syntax>divs</Syntax>: one with a class of <Syntax>container</Syntax> and one with a class of <Syntax>box</Syntax>.

```html
<body>
  <div class="container"></div>
  <div class="box"></div>
</body>
```

Let's also create some CSS styles for these elements.

```css
.box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: blue;
}
.container {
  border: 1px solid #000;
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  margin-left: 40%;
  margin-top: 10%;
  transform: rotate(-30deg);
}
```

Now let's do some basic JavaScript setup.

We'll start by "registering" the **Flip** plugin:

```js
gsap.registerPlugin(Flip);
```

After that, let's get references to the <Syntax>container</Syntax> and the <Syntax>box</Syntax> elements.

```js
gsap.registerPlugin(Flip);

const container = document.querySelector(".container");
const box = document.querySelector(".box");
```

---

## First

Now that we have some initial setup out of the way, let's satisfy the **First** part of the **Flip** acronym:
getting the initial state of the element.

For this, the **Flip** plugin gives us a method called **getState**.
We pass in the box <Syntax>div</Syntax> to **getState** because it's the element we want to re-parent.
And **getState** will record it's initial rotation, size, position, and skew.

```js
gsap.registerPlugin(Flip);

const container = document.querySelector(".container");
const box = document.querySelector(".box");

document.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  let state = Flip.getState(".box");
});
```

---

## Last

The next step of the process is called **Last**.

In this step, we want to do something to the element to put it into its final state.

For example, we could add a class to the element using the **classList** method.
And that added class could do various things such as changing its size, rotation, position, etc.

Another example of a **Last** state would be something where we re-parent the element.
And that's exactly what we're going to do.

We'll take our <Syntax>container</Syntax> element and use the **appendChild** method to re-parent the box <Syntax>div</Syntax>.

```js
gsap.registerPlugin(Flip);

const container = document.querySelector(".container");
const box = document.querySelector(".box");

document.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  let state = Flip.getState(".box");
  container.appendChild(box);
});
```

---

## Invert and Play

Then, finally, we'll look at **Invert** and **Play**.

To work with these steps, the **Flip** plugin provides a method called **from**.
The **from** method is where the real magic happens because it makes the transition happen automatically. âœ¨

<br />

The **from** method takes two arguments:

- the state or initial state that was recorded
- an **options object** (_If you've worked with **GSAP**, you're probably familiar with the **options object**.
  This **options object** can contain properties like **duration** and **ease**._)

```js
gsap.registerPlugin(Flip);

const container = document.querySelector(".container");
const box = document.querySelector(".box");

document.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
  let state = Flip.getState(".box");
  container.appendChild(box);
  Flip.from(state, { duration: 1, ease: "power1.out" });
});
```

During the **Invert** and **Play** stages, **Flip** already knows about the initial and final states of the element. So it can apply offsets to the element to make it appear first in its initial state.
Then it animates the _removal_ of those offsets to transition it to its final state.
