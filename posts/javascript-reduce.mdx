## What is the Reduce method?

Let's try to simplify and understand JavaScript's [**reduce**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce) method.

**Reduce** is a method that can be used on arrays to take multiple values and _reduce_ them to a single value.

For example, we could take an array of numbers and reduce them to a single value representing the sum of those numbers.

  height={488 / 2}

/>

Or, we could take an array of objects and total up the values from a specific property
on those objects.

We could also, for example, take an array of letter strings and reduce those letters to a single string.

**Reduce** is like a "Swiss Army Knife" of JavaScript array methods!

## A Code Example

Let's move forward and see **reduce** in action.

For this example, we'll see how we can get the total value of a particular property from objects in an array.

Let's create a <Syntax>const</Syntax> called <Syntax>spiceGirls</Syntax> and set it equal to an array of objects.
Notice that each one of these objects has a <Syntax>name</Syntax> property and a <Syntax>numCats</Syntax> property(short for _number of cats_).

```js
const spiceGirls = [
  { name: "ginger", numCats: 2 },
  { name: "sporty", numCats: 1 },
  { name: "baby", numCats: 0 },
  { name: "posh", numCats: 3 },
  { name: "scary", numCats: 6 },
];
```

With **reduce**, we can collectively sum up the number of cats the Spice Girls have.
Essentially, we want to take this array of objects and reduce it to a single numeric value.

/>

And that's one of the cool things about **reduce**.
We can start with an array and reduce it to a value of several different types:
object, array, simple string, numeric, etc.

In this case, we'll reduce it to a single number.

The first thing we'll do is take that <Syntax>spiceGirls</Syntax> array and call **reduce** on it.

```js
const totalCats = spiceGirls.reduce(() => {});
```

Now, **reduce** takes two arguments:

- a callback function (aka the _reducer_)
- an initial value

Let's set our initial value to zero.

```js
const totalCats = spiceGirls.reduce(() => {}, 0);
```

Now let's look at the reducer callback function.

The reducer callback accepts at least two arguments:

- the accumulator (<Syntax>accum</Syntax> for short)
- current value (<Syntax>currValue</Syntax> for short)

(As with array methods like [map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) and [filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter), current value represents each element in the array).

```js
const totalCats = spiceGirls.reduce((accum, currValue) => {}, 0);
```

So **reduce** will iterate(loop) through each element of the array (which will be the current value
for that iteration).

And our **accumulator** will be initialized to a value of zero.

Think of the **accumulator** as a sponge.
On each iteration, it's going to "soak" up a calculation.

  alt="the reduce method's accumulator is like a sponge"
/>

<br />

Then, we'll return the result of that calculation as the new **accumulator** value for the next iteration.

For this example, we add the **accumulator** value to <Syntax>currValue.numCats</Syntax>.
(<Syntax>numCats</Syntax> is the particular property whose value we want to tally up on each iteration).

BTW, a critical but often forgotten aspect of working with **reduce** is that the new value must be returned.

And logging <Syntax>totalCats</Syntax> to the console yields a single numeric value of 12.

```js
const totalCats = spiceGirls.reduce((accum, currValue) => {
  return accum + currValue.numCats;
}, 0);
console.log(totalCats);
```

## A Closer Look at Initial Value

Let's take a closer look at that initial value we had set to zero.

Since we had provided the initial value, the **accumulator** was initialized to 0.
This sets the current value to the first element in the array for the first iteration.

```js
const totalCats = spiceGirls.reduce((accum, currValue) => {
  return accum + currValue.numCats;
}, 0);
```

And because we provided that initial value as a numeric value of 0, the calculation returned: 0 + 2.
(_2 being the number of cats from the first object in the array_).

```js
const spiceGirls = [
  { name: "ginger", numCats: 2 },
  { name: "sporty", numCats: 1 },
  { name: "baby", numCats: 0 },
  { name: "posh", numCats: 3 },
  { name: "scary", numCats: 6 },
];
```

However, if we omit the initial value, the console will log <Syntax>[object Object] 1036</Syntax>.

So when the initial value is omitted, <Syntax>accum</Syntax> is initialized to the first element in the array.
And <Syntax>currValue</Syntax> gets initialized to the second element in the array.

Since we're targeting the <Syntax>numCats</Syntax> property on each iteration, the object tries adding to a numeric value.
That's why we get <Syntax>[object Object] 1036</Syntax> in the console rather than a single numeric value.
