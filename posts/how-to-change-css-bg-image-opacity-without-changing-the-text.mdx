## Introduction


Have you ever had that annoying situation where you can't get your foreground
text to contrast enough with your background image?

<Image
  src="/images/blog/how-to-change-css-bg-image-opacity/low-contrast-image.png"
  width={600}
  height={278}
  layout="responsive"
  alt="example of low contast between foreground text and background image "
/>

<br />

So what do you do?
Well, you probably come into the **CSS** rule that holds the background
image and try lowering its opacity.

But then, lo and behold, you notice that the foreground text opacity has also been reduced. ðŸ˜ 

<Image
  src="/images/blog/how-to-change-css-bg-image-opacity/lower-contrast-image.png"
  width={600}
  height={278}
  layout="responsive"
  alt="lowering the background image's opacity also lowers the nested text's opacity"
/>

Let's figure out a solution to this common conundrum!

<hr />

## Why Does This Problem Occur?

Notice in the **HTML** for this example that the **h1** is nested inside the **section** element.

```html
<body>
  <section>
    <h1>WINTER MADNESS</h1>
  </section>
</body>
```

The problem occurs because this **h1** _inherits_ its opacity from the **CSS** rule for the **section**.

So, in the **CSS**, when we lower the **section** element's opacity, we're 
also lowering the opacity of the **h1**.

```css
section {
  height: 100vh;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  background-image: url("images/pexels-magda-ehlers-714482.jpg");
  background-size: cover;
  opacity: 0.3;
}

h1 {
  color: #fff;
}
```

Therefore, we need to sever this inheritance connection!

<hr />

## Finding the Solution With Pseudo-Elements

To solve this problem, let's work on putting those background image properties onto a [pseudo-element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements).
(_pseudo-elements allow you to style specific parts of an element_).

We'll use the **before** pseudo-element and apply it to the **section** rule.
The **before** pseudo-element will act as the first child element of the **section**.

Let's set it to have a **content** property with the value of an empty string. 

```css
section {
  height: 100vh;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  background-image: url("images/pexels-magda-ehlers-714482.jpg");
  background-size: cover;
}

section::before {
  content: "";
}

h1 {
  color: #fff;
}
```
<br />

We can see that pseudo-element in Google Chrome's developer console.
<Image

  width={600}
  height={313}
  layout="responsive"
  alt="examining the pseudo-element in the developer console"
/>

<br />
<br />

Now, let's take the background image properties off the **section** element and put them on the **before** pseudo-element.

```css
section {
  height: 100vh;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}

section::before {
  background-image: url("images/pexels-magda-ehlers-714482.jpg");
  background-size: cover;
  content: "";
}

h1 {
  color: #fff;
}
```

<hr />

## Sizing and Positioning the Pseudo-Element

Before we can see this pseudo-element in the viewport though, we'll need it to fill out the width and height of the parent **section** element.
To accomplish this, we'll give it a **position: absolute**.

```css
section::before {
  background-image: url("images/pexels-magda-ehlers-714482.jpg");
  background-size: cover;
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
}
```
<br />

Typically, an element with **position: absolute**, needs to be set it in relation to a parent element.
Since we want to set it in relation to the **section** element, we'll give the **section** rule a **position: relative**.

```css
section {
  height: 100vh;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  position: relative;
}
```
<br />

Now, we need to define our top, right, bottom, and left settings for this absolutely positioned pseudo-element.

To do this all at once, we can use the [inset](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inset) property and set it to a value of zero.

```css
section {
  height: 100vh;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  position: relative;
}

section::before {
  background-image: url("images/pexels-magda-ehlers-714482.jpg");
  background-size: cover;
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
}
```

<br />
<br />

Now you'll see the background image magically appear in the viewport! âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨

<Image
  src="/images/blog/how-to-change-css-bg-image-opacity/foreground-text-not-visible.png"
  width={600}
  height={276}
  layout="responsive"
  alt="background image but no visible foreground text"
/>

<br />

But hold on...don't get too excited just yet. Where's the **h1**? ðŸ¤”

<hr />

## Creating a Stacking Context for the H1 Text

The **h1** is currently getting hidden in the stacking order. This is because the **section** and **section::before**
pseudo-element have their positions set to **relative** and **absolute**.

Fortunately, we can remedy this with a handy property called [isolation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/isolation).

If we set **isolation**, on the **h1**, to have a value of **isolate**, we can create a new stacking context.
That will get the **h1** out in front of those other elements.

```css
h1 {
  color: #fff;
  isolation: isolate;
}
```
<br />

And now, with the **h1** visible, we can lower the opacity of the background image _independently_ from the text.

Also, in the **section** rule, setting a background color of black(#000) helps improve the contrast between background and foreground as the pseudo-element's opacity is lowered.

```css
section {
  height: 100vh;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  position: relative;
  background-color: #000;
}

section::before {
  background-image: url("images/pexels-magda-ehlers-714482.jpg");
  background-size: cover;
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  opacity: 0.4;
}

h1 {
  color: #fff;
  isolation: isolate;
}
```

  width={600}
  height={284}
  layout="responsive"
  alt="good contrast between background image and foreground text"
/>

<br />

Experiment by tweaking the opacity value in the pseudo-element and the background color value in the **section** element to taste.
