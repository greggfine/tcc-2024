that allows for complex audio manipulation, synthesis, and effects.

The library provides a higher-level abstraction, making it easier to create complex musical structures and patterns.
This allows programmers to approach coding from a more musical perspective, as Tone.js includes concepts such as note values,
a DAW-like transport, a built-in arpeggiator, and more. Basically, it simplifies the process of creating music on the web.

## Who created Tone.js?

Tone.js was created by [Yotam Mann](https://yotammann.info/about) in 2014. Mann is a music technologist and interactive audio developer who has worked
on a variety of projects, including the [Google Creative Lab](https://yotammann.info/musiclab).

He created Tone.js to provide a better way for musicians and artists to work with the Web Audio API.

Since its creation, Tone.js has become one of the more popular libraries for working with the Web Audio API.
As of this writing, Tone.js has over 12K GitHub stars and 19,000 weekly downloads on NPM.

## What is the Web Audio API?
