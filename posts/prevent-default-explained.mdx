If you work with JavaScript events before, you've likely come across the [**preventDefault**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault) method.

In this article, we'll learn what **preventDefault** is and how we can use it in our code.

## Default Browser Events

First of all, let's talk about browser events in general. You see, most of the events that occur in the browser have default actions associated with them.

For example, let's say we had an **anchor** tag for "wikipedia.org"

```html
<a href="https://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>
```

<Image

  width={914}
  height={374}
  layout="responsive"
  alt="clicking on an anchor tag for wikipedia"
/>

When we click on it, it takes us to wikipedia.org.
No surprise there!

For that action to happen, however, notice that we didn't have to do anything special.
All we did was set up an **anchor** tag with an <Syntax>href</Syntax> attribute.
We didn't explicitly create an event handler for this.

The browser has a _default_ action for **anchor** tags.
And that default action takes us to the link specified by the <Syntax>href</Syntax>.

<br />

There are, of course, other default actions that the browser executes for various event types.

For example, by default, clicking on an input of type **checkbox** toggles it on and off.

```html
<a href="https://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> <input type="checkbox" />
```

<Image

  width={1251}
  height={360}
  layout="responsive"
  alt="unchecked input of type 'checkbox'"
/>

<br />

<Image

  width={1113}
  height={383}
  layout="responsive"
  alt="checked input of type 'checkbox'"
/>

Again, notice we did nothing explicitly to enable that.

<br />

Another example could be input fields.
When the user types into an input field, text characters get added, yet we don't create that behavior ourselves.

And, perhaps, the most common browser default is on a form submission.
When a user clicks the **submit** button in a form, that form, by default, takes us to the URL value of its **action** attribute.

## Overriding Default Behavior

Sometimes, though, we don't want the default action the browser gives us when an event is fired.

Instead, we want to implement some custom behavior or functionality.

Let's see how we can do that in our code using **preventDefault**.

For this example, let's write some JavaScript.

Let's listen for an event on the **window** object. That event will be the **contextmenu** event.

```js
window.addEventListener("contextmenu", (e) => {
  console.log(e);
});
```

Here we're using the **addEventListener** method to register an event handler which will be invoked
when the **contextmenu** event type is fired.

The **contextmenu**, fired by right-clicking the mouse or with a control-click(_on a Mac_), looks something like this:

<Image

  width={1922}
  height={1088}
  layout="responsive"
  alt="context menu popup on a Mac"
/>

<br />
<br />

And note that whenever we use **addEventListener**, we automatically get access to an **event object**.

<Image
  src="/images/blog/prevent-default-explained-in-javascript/event-object.png"
  width={2860}
  height={1608}
  layout="responsive"
  alt="group of web developers working with the JavaScript Event Object"
/>

<br />

In our code example, we refer to that **event object** with the letter **e**.
(The letter **e** is a common naming shorthand for the **event object**. You will also
often see this referred to as **ev** or **evt**).

<br />

If we fire that **contextmenu** event, we can see the **event object** in the console.
(_it's a **PointerEvent** in this case_)

  width={2804}
  height={1524}
  layout="responsive"
  alt="examining a JavaScript event object in Google Chrome Dev Tools console"
/>

<br />
<br />
<br />

Now, before we prevent the default on the **contextmenu** event, let's spice things up by adding a couple elements inside our **body** tags.

What we're going to do is prevent that context menu from showing up when the user right-clicks.
Instead, we're going to surprise them with an image!

<br />

So, let's make a <Syntax>div</Syntax> and give it a class of **container**.
Let's also create a <Syntax>p</Syntax> tag with the text content "Right-click for a spicy surprise!".
(_This <Syntax>div</Syntax> will be empty for now but we'll ultimately append our image to it._)

```html
<body>
  <p>Right-click for a spicy surprise!</p>
  <div class="container"></div>
</body>
```

<Image
  src="/images/blog/prevent-default-explained-in-javascript/spicy-surprise.png"
  width={1524}
  height={784}
  layout="responsive"
  alt="browser displaying the text content of the paragraph tag"
/>

<br />
<br />

And now, in our event listener, instead of logging the **event object**, we'll call the **preventDefault** method.
Using **preventDefault** here should prevent that context menu from appearing.

```js
window.addEventListener("contextmenu", (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
});
```

Now that we've successfully prevented the browser's default behavior, let's get a reference to the container <Syntax>div</Syntax> element.

```js
const container = document.querySelector(".container");

window.addEventListener("contextmenu", (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
});
```

Then, let's create an image element:

```js
const container = document.querySelector(".container");

window.addEventListener("contextmenu", (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  const img = document.createElement("img");
});
```

And let's point the image source to a file I have in my directory called **girls.jpg**.

```js
const container = document.querySelector(".container");

window.addEventListener("contextmenu", (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  const img = document.createElement("img");
  img.src = "girls.jpg";
});
```

Now, we can append that image element to the container:

```js
const container = document.querySelector(".container");

window.addEventListener("contextmenu", (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  const img = document.createElement("img");
  img.src = "girls.jpg";
  container.appendChild(img);
});
```

Ok, time to right-click and see what happens...

<Image

  width={1590}
  height={1100}
  layout="responsive"
  alt="The Spice Girls without the context menu blocking them"
/>

Look at that! It's the Spice Girls! üòç

<br />
<br />

If we hadn't used **preventDefault** and tried to right-click, you'll see the context menu obscuring our view of the Spice Girls.
And that's not a very good user experience, is it? üòÉ

  width={1886}
  height={1338}
  layout="responsive"
  alt="The Spice Girls with the context menu blocking them"
/>

<br />
<br />

As silly as this example might be, it hopefully clarified the role that **preventDefault** plays.

By using **preventDefault**, we can stop the browser's default behavior and substitute another behavior for the default one.
