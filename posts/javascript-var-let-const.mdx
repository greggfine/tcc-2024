JavaScript has so many ways to declare variables: <Syntax>var</Syntax>, <Syntax>let</Syntax>, <Syntax>const</Syntax>.

Which one to pick?

This post will clarify the differences between these JavaScript keywords. And once we understand the nuances
between them, we‚Äôll be on our way to making the right choice.

**ES2015 (ES6)** introduced <Syntax>let</Syntax> and <Syntax>const</Syntax> to the
JavaScript language.

Before **ES2015**, <Syntax>var</Syntax> was the only keyword available for
holding values.{" "}

## Var

The <Syntax> var </Syntax> keyword, compared to <Syntax>let</Syntax>, and <Syntax>const</Syntax>, has the most
flexibility.

**It can be redeclared with a new value. Its value can also be updated**.

<br />

To make sure that we're on the same page so far, let's illustrate this with an example.

<br />

If we declare:

```js
var name = "Frank";
```

We can then redeclare:

```js
var name = "Bob";
```

Now, if we want to update the value assigned to <Syntax>var name</Syntax>, we
can do:

```js
name = "Bobby";
```

/>
## Const

Now we can examine the <Syntax>const</Syntax> keyword, which is practically the polar
opposite of the <Syntax>var</Syntax> keyword.

This is because, unlike <Syntax>var</Syntax>, a <Syntax>const</Syntax> **can‚Äôt be
redeclared nor can it be updated**.

<br />

Let's take a look at an example.

If we declare:

```js
const name = "Frank";
```

We're unable to redeclare <Syntax>const name</Syntax>:

```js
const name = "Bob";
```

Doing so will result in a [SyntaxError](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SyntaxError) letting us know that <Error>Identifier ‚Äòname‚Äô
has already been declared</Error>.

<br />
And an attempt to update the assignment of <Syntax>const name</Syntax>:

```js
name = "Bobby";
```

will result in a [TypeError](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypeError)<Error> Assignment to constant variable! </Error>

/>

<br />
<br />

One source of confusion is that the thing that is constant is the **binding** of
the declared <Syntax>const</Syntax> to the value. It's not necessarily that the value itself
becomes immutable.

When the value assigned is a primitive(string,
number, boolean, null, undefined, or symbol), the value is immutable. However, when
the value is an object, like an array, mutation of the value is possible.

<br />

To demonstrate the mutability of an object when declared as a <Syntax> const</Syntax>, we‚Äôll first declare <Syntax>const</Syntax> <Syntax>colors</Syntax> as an Array:

```js
const colors = [‚Äúblue‚Äù, ‚Äúred‚Äù, ‚Äúgreen‚Äù, ‚Äúyellow‚Äù];
```

We can then <Syntax>push</Syntax>, for example, to this array without problem:

```js
colors.push(‚Äúpurple‚Äù);
```

Now the value of <Syntax>const</Syntax> <Syntax>colors</Syntax> is:

```js
[‚Äúblue‚Äù, ‚Äúred‚Äù, ‚Äúgreen‚Äù, ‚Äúyellow‚Äù, ‚Äúpurple‚Äù]
```

See, that array was mutable after all. üôÇ

<br />A good rule of thumb for <Syntax>const</Syntax> is to use <Syntax>
  const
</Syntax> when we have data we _do not expect to rebind_. Not only does it help
prevent accidental reassignment, but it also helps communicate our intent for
both our future selves as well as others who may read our code.

## Let

Now, the JavaScript <Syntax>let</Syntax> keyword falls in the middle of <Syntax>var</Syntax> and <Syntax>const</Syntax> in terms
of flexibility. Because, unlike <Syntax>var</Syntax>, **redeclaration is not possible**. Like <Syntax>var</Syntax>,
however, **it is possible to update**.

<br />

Let's look at <Syntax>let</Syntax> in the context of our previous examples.

If we declare:

```js
let name = "Frank";
```

We're unable to redeclare <Syntax>let</Syntax> <Syntax>name</Syntax>:

```js
let name = "Bob";
```

The result is a **SyntaxError** letting us know that <Error>Identifier ‚Äòname‚Äô has
already been declared</Error>

<br />
Updating the assignment of <Syntax>let</Syntax> <Syntax>name</Syntax>, however,
is valid:

```js
name = "Bobby";
```

## Scope

We‚Äôve seen how binding works with <Syntax>var</Syntax>, <Syntax>let</Syntax>, and <Syntax>const</Syntax>.

Another big idea to discuss to help clarify the differences between these keywords is [Scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope).

Before **ES2015**, there were two kinds of scope: **Global** and **Function**.

Now, however, we have ‚Äú**Block Scope**‚Äù as well.

Anytime we have curly brackets, as in an **If** statement, **Block Scope** is indicated. (Some other places to find <Syntax>Block Scope</Syntax> are with the <Syntax>For</Syntax>, <Syntax>While</Syntax>, and <Syntax>Do</Syntax> keywords).

The idea behind scope, in general, is that it lets us know where variables are available within our program.

So, a variable assigned within a function, for example, is said to be locally scoped to that particular function.

We can think of the curly brackets as a fence or prison walls within which it confines locally scoped variables.

  alt="The 'let' and 'const' keywords are block scoped. It's like they're behind prison walls because they can't be accessed from their outer environment."
/>

<br />
<br />

Both <Syntax>const</Syntax> and <Syntax>let</Syntax> are block scoped. And the benefit of block scoping is that
it prevents these variables from being accessible from their outer
environment.

Usually, a <Syntax>var</Syntax> declared within a function is only accessible
within that function.

Take the following function as an example:

```js
function sayName() {
    var name = ‚ÄúFrank‚Äù;
    console.log(name);
}
```

If we then try to log **name** in the global scope, we get a
[ReferenceError](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ReferenceError): <Error>name is not defined</Error>. Here, we can say that <Syntax>var</Syntax> is function
scoped.

Block scoping, however, is like a more specific level of scope.

Take this example:

```js
function sayName() {
  var name = "Frank";
  {
    let color = "red";
  }
  console.log(name);
  console.log(color);
}
```

Although this example isn't too practical, it illustrates the point.

In this case, once we invoke <Syntax>sayName</Syntax>, we see ‚ÄúFrank‚Äù printed to the console.

However, we get a ReferenceError: <Error>color is not defined</Error>.

As we can see, since we used the <Syntax>let</Syntax> keyword when declaring <Syntax>color</Syntax>, <Syntax>color</Syntax> is block scoped.

Therefore, it's only available within the curly brackets in which it resides.{" "}
