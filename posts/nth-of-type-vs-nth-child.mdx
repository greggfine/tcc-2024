There are two structural [pseudo-class selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes#tree-structural_pseudo-classes) in CSS whose distinction can be tricky to grasp at first.

In this article, let's compare the **nth-of-type** and **nth-child** selectors to
better understand the difference.

## Nth-of-Type

First of all, let's look at an example of **nth-of-type**.

Here we have an unordered list containing four list items:

{/* <CodeBlock js={"hello"}></CodeBlock> */}

```html
<ul>
  <li>one</li>
  <li>two</li>
  <li>three</li>
  <li>four</li>
</ul>
```

Now, what if we wanted to color the second <Syntax>li</Syntax>(list item) red in our CSS?

We would write <Syntax>li:nth-of-type</Syntax> and then, in parentheses, put the number two.

```css
li:nth-of-type(2) {
  color: red;
}
```

So, what does this translate to?

_"In a group of siblings of type <Syntax>li</Syntax>, select the second one."_

  alt="example of selecting the second li tag using the nth-of-type CSS selector"
/>

<br />

If we had put the number four in the parentheses instead of the number two, the fourth <Syntax>li</Syntax> would have been the one selected.

  width={1634}
  height={614}
  layout="responsive"
  src="/images/blog/nth-of-type-vs-nth-child/4th-li.png"
  alt="example of selecting the fourth li tag using the nth-of-type CSS selector"
/>
The salient thing to note is that we're talking about a **group of siblings**.

<br />

Let's bump up the complexity a bit and add a second <Syntax>ul</Syntax> with two nested <Syntax>li's</Syntax>.

```html
<ul>
  <li>one</li>
  <li>two</li>
  <li>three</li>
  <li>four</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>nested one</li>
  <li>nested two</li>
</ul>
```

Now, if we try selecting <Syntax>li:nth-of-type(2)</Syntax> again and applying the color red, which li's do you think will get the color?

We'll see that the second <Syntax>li</Syntax> from the first <Syntax>ul</Syntax> group and the second <Syntax>li</Syntax> from the second <Syntax>ul</Syntax> group get colored red because, each time a group of siblings occurs, the count starts again.

/>

## Nth-Child

Let's now contrast this with the way that **nth-child** works.

Again, let's look at the unordered list from our first example.

If we select <Syntax>li:nth-child(2)</Syntax> and apply the color red to it, we
see that the second <Syntax>li</Syntax> in this group of <Syntax>li's</Syntax> gets the color red.

```css
li:nth-child(2) {
  color: red;
}
```

<Image
  width={1634}
  height={371}
  layout="responsive"
  src="/images/blog/nth-of-type-vs-nth-child/second-li-has-become-red.png"
  alt="example of selecting the second li tag using the nth-child CSS selector"
/>

So far, this seems to be doing the same thing that nth-of-type(2) did.

Is there any difference?

Yes, there is!

With **nth-child**, the criteria's not:

_"find the second <Syntax>li</Syntax> in a group of sibling <Syntax>li's</Syntax>"_

But rather:

_"find the <Syntax>li</Syntax> that's the second child of a parent element"_

<br />
In this case, that second <Syntax>li</Syntax> just also happens to be the second
child of its parent
<Syntax>ul</Syntax>.

<br />

But what if we inserted a paragraph element as the first child of the <Syntax>ul</Syntax>?

```html
<ul>
  <p>parent</p>
  <li>one</li>
  <li>two</li>
  <li>three</li>
  <li>four</li>
</ul>
```

Now which <Syntax>li</Syntax> will get the color red?

It's actually going to be the first <Syntax>li</Syntax> in the sibling group because it's the second child of the <Syntax>ul</Syntax>.

  alt="example of selecting the first li tag using the nth-child CSS selector"
/>

<br />
Just to make it clear, if we added one more <Syntax>p</Syntax> element inside the <Syntax>
  ul
</Syntax> and did <Syntax>li:nth-child(2)</Syntax>...

```html
<ul>
  <p>parent</p>
  <p>parent 2</p>
  <li>one</li>
  <li>two</li>
  <li>three</li>
  <li>four</li>
</ul>
```

```css
li:nth-child(2) {
  color: red;
}
```

nothing at all would get the color red because there isn't a <Syntax>li</Syntax> here that's also
the second child of a parent!

Hopefully, this helps to clarify the difference between **nth-of-type** and **nth-child**!
