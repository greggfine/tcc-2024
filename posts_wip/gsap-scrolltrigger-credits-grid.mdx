## Introduction

    In the Text Reveal Animation project, we learned about staggered animations.

And we saw a simple form of using staggers where we applied a number to the stagger property.

In this project, we’re going to go much further and learn about advanced stagger animations.
There are many additional properties that GSAP gives us when working with staggers and
we’ll take advantage of them in this project to create this Credits Container/Grid.

The idea comes from this site called the-goonies.webflow.io and I created my own version of it
for this project.

As I scroll down, I get to this credits section where we see the Release date, Story by, Production Company,
Distributer, Budget, and more.

You can imagine this could’ve been done with a simple boring list of text.
However, this grid format is a much more fun and entertaining way of showing this content.

If you look at the animation for each part of the grid, you can see two things happening:
firstly, there’s the text content which animates up from the bottom.
secondly, there are the images and display text that animate within each grid.

And they animate in different ways.
We have some moving in horizontally. Some moving in vertically.
And some fading in.

Also notice that they don’t all animate in at the same time but rather stagger their entrances.
