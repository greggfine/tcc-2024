## Introduction

In this article, we’ll create a cool text animation effect using GSAP
and ScrollTrigger.

In particular, we’ll use stagger in conjunction with scrubbing to create
an effect where each consecutive line of text fills out its color
and becomes more opaque.

## Demo the Final Product

## HTML

Let's start by setting up some HTML boilerplate in our index.html file.

Via a series of script tags, we'll import the GSAP library, ScrollTrigger plugin,
and our own custom app.js file.

We'll also link to our styles.css file in the head.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Document</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/
gsap/3.11.3/gsap.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/
gsap/3.11.3/ScrollTrigger.min.js"></script>
    <script src="app.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

<br />

Withing the body, create a section element with a class of container.
This will serve as the container for a series of paragraph tags.

I've created three paragraph elements for this project but the number
and content are up to you.

```html
  <body>
    <section class="container">
      <p>Learning</p>
      <p>scrollytelling with</p>
      <p>The Code Creative</p>
    </section>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/
gsap/3.11.3/gsap.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/
gsap/3.11.3/ScrollTrigger.min.js"></script>
    <script src="app.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

<br />
<br />

## CSS

In styles, css, create a rule for the container div.

Give it a height of 200vh to get some vertical scrolling in the browser.

Also, give it some margin-top.
This will provide space before the scroller-start point is reached.

```css
.container {
  height: 200vh;
  margin-top: 200px;
}
```

<br />
<br />

Now, create a rule for the paragraph tags.

In this rule, we can amp up the drama by increasing the font-size.
We'll set it to 10vw.
(By using vw(viewport width units), the text will scale with the width of the viewport.)

Also, zero out the margins to eliminate the default paragraph styles provided by the user-agent.
This will bring the paragraph lines closer together and make them feel more unified.

```css
.container {
  height: 200vh;
  margin-top: 200px;
}

p {
  margin: 0;
  font-size: 10vw;
}
```

<br />
<br />

## Creating a Linear-Gradient

Moving forward, let's set up a linear-gradient for the paragraph background color.

This linear-gradient will flow to the right.

And the stops of white and dark grey will each take 50% of the gradient.

```css
.container {
  height: 200vh;
  margin-top: 200px;
}

p {
  margin: 0;
  font-size: 10vw;
  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, white 50%, rgb(50, 45, 45) 50%);
}
```

<br />
<br />

Next, let's use the background-size property to double the gradient's width to 200%.

Now, the the white portion of the gradient will cover the full width of the paragraph.
(experiment with different width values to see how this works)

```css
p {
  margin: 0;
  font-size: 10vw;
  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, white 50%, rgb(50, 45, 45) 50%);
  background-size: 200% 100%;
}
```

<br />
<br />

We'll compensate for this increase in width by setting the background-position-x property to 100%.

This will move the right edge of the gradient(the dark grey part) to the right edge of the paragraph element.

You should now see the text covered by this grey background.

This background-position-x property is what we'll be animating with JavaScript.
Hence the need to set its initial position to 100%.

```css
p {
  margin: 0;
  font-size: 10vw;
  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, white 50%, rgb(50, 45, 45) 50%);
  background-size: 200% 100%;
  background-position-x: 100%;
}
```

<br />
<br />

## Clipping the Background Gradient to Text

Next, set a background-clip property to a value of “text”.
(also, use the webkit prefix for browser compatibility)

Once we do this, the background gradient's color will be clipped to the text content.

```css
p {
  margin: 0;
  font-size: 10vw;
  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, white 50%, rgb(50, 45, 45) 50%);
  background-size: 200% 100%;
  background-position-x: 100%;
  background-clip: text;
  -webkit-background-clip: text;
}
```

<br />
<br />

Set the paragraph's color property to transparent.
(Note: this is the same as using rgba(0,0,0,0))

This allows the animated linear-gradient to come through as the text's color.

And we can see the initial gradient color once we apply a background-color to the containing body element.

```css
body {
  background-color: #0e0017;
}
.container {
  height: 200vh;
  margin-top: 200px;
}

p {
  margin: 0;
  font-size: 10vw;
  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, white 50%, rgb(50, 45, 45) 50%);
  background-size: 200% 100%;
  background-position-x: 100%;
  color: transparent;
  background-clip: text;
  -webkit-background-clip: text;
}
```

## JavaScript

In app.js, let's start by registering the ScrollTrigger plugin.

```js
gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger);
```

<br />
<br />

We'll use the gsap.to method to animate that background-position-x property.
(The elements we'll be animating are the paragraphs.)

Because we're in JavaScript-land, we need to use the camel case version of the property:
backgroundPositionX

Set it to 0%.
(Remember, we want that background.gradient's left edge(white) to move to the left edge
of the paragraph element.)

```js
gsap.to("p", {
  backgroundPositionX: "0%",
});
```

<br />
<br />

To preview the effect, we can temporarily set a duration property to 5 seconds.

As you can see, each paragraph animates at the same time.

```js
gsap.to("p", {
  backgroundPositionX: "0%",
  duration: 5,
});
```

<br />
<br />j However, we want those animations to be staggered. i.e., we want each successive
paragraph's animation to start later than the previous one.

So, rather than using the duration property, use the stagger property and set it to a value of 0.7.
(We'll tweak this later.)

```js
gsap.to("p", {
  backgroundPositionX: "0%",
  stagger: 0.7,
});
```

<br />
<br />

## Incorporating ScrollTrigger

The next step is to bring in ScrollTrigger.

We’ll use the scrollTrigger property and assign it to an object.
In this object, we’ll make the paragraph elements the trigger.

Let’s also enable markers to visualize the scroller zone.

```js
gsap.to("p", {
  backgroundPositionX: "0%",
  stagger: 0.7,
  scrollTrigger: {
    trigger: "p",
    markers: true,
  },
});
```

At the moment, the animation plays immediately since we've already passed the scroller-start.
(scroller-start defaults bottom of the viewport)
We want the animation to start though as we scroll up into the scroller zone.

So, let’s set a “start” property with the value “top 15%.

This means that the animation will only start once the top of the paragraph trigger element reaches 15% down from the top of the viewport.

```js
gsap.to("p", {
  backgroundPositionX: "0%",
  stagger: 0.7,
  scrollTrigger: {
    trigger: "p",
    scrub: 1,
    start: "top 15%",
    markers: true,
  },
});
```

Let’s also set a scrub property and assign it a value of 1.
We could set scrub to true but, using a number, will give a bit looser of a feel to the scrub playhead.

```js
gsap.to("p", {
  backgroundPositionX: "0%",
  stagger: 0.7,
  scrollTrigger: {
    trigger: "p",
    scrub: 1,
    start: "top 15%",
    markers: true,
  },
});
```

To fine-tune the stagger, I’ll set it to 0.4.

Now, each staggered element will start 400ms after the previous element.

```js
gsap.to("p", {
  backgroundPositionX: "0%",
  stagger: 0.4,
  scrollTrigger: {
    trigger: "p",
    scrub: 1,
    start: "top 15%",
    markers: true,
  },
});
```

For the finished product, don’t forget to disable the markers!
