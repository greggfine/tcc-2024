## Introduction

When you’re looking for a web developer, it can be hard to know what questions to ask. You might want someone who is super friendly and easy going or a more serious professional. Here are some questions to ask yourself before choosing your web developer:

## How to choose a web developer

As you're looking for a web developer, here are some things you should consider:

- **Look for someone who will be available to answer your questions and provide updates:** If you're going to hire someone, you want to feel confident that they will be there when needed—even if it's just an email or phone call away.
- **Consider how quickly the developer is able to respond to your needs:** If something isn't working right with the site, do they get right on fixing it? Or do they put it off until next week? If something catches fire in their office and all of their servers explode, would they come up with an alternate solution instead of letting everyone down because they didn't have time to fix things before then?
- **Think about whether or not this person is easy-going enough for both parties' personalities:** if not then neither one of them will enjoy working together over time!

It's also important to consider how well you communicate with this person. If they don't speak English well or if your native language isn't English, things might get lost in translation. Make sure that both parties understand each other clearly before signing any contracts!

## What will our relationship look like?

If you're hiring a web developer, you likely have a strong idea of what kind of website you want and how it should function. When choosing your web developer, take some time to consider how often you'll be in contact with them and how they'll communicate with you.

This is an important step in finding the right fit for your project because different developers will have different processes for working with clients. For example, some prefer email while others may prefer an online task management system like Basecamp or Trello. Some prefer Skype calls while other prefer video conferences on Zoom or Google Hangouts. It's important that the tools used by your developer align with those used by their team so that everyone can work together efficiently across multiple platforms without confusion about who's doing what task or when it needs to be completed by someone else on the team (i.e., developers vs designers).

## What is your process for creating a website?

- **Research:** You will want to know what the competition is doing, what products and services you want to offer, and how your potential customers are searching for those products and services.
- **Design:** The design process can be quick or take months depending on the size of your project, but it’s important that you get a sense of how your site will look before writing any code.
- **Development:** During this stage, you will work with a developer to write code that makes up your website’s framework (also known as “back-end”). This stage usually takes 1–2 weeks from start to launch date or delivery date (depending on project).

## Will I be able to make my own changes to the site after it’s done?

This is a big question, and it may not be the first thing on your mind when you're searching for a web developer. But if your site isn't working for you, or if there are things that could be done better (of course there are), it's going to be frustrating if you can't make the changes yourself.

If this sounds like something that might matter to you, ask whether or not they offer customization packages after launch. Some developers charge extra for this service; others include it in their rates and let customers take advantage of any updates without additional charge.

## How many revisions do I get in the design process and how long will it take?

You will get at least two revisions in the design process. This is generally enough to ensure that you are happy with your website’s look and feel, but I can usually accommodate more if needed. Once we finalize the design, it takes me a few days to actually build out the site and launch it on our staging environment so that we can make sure everything works properly before launching live.

## How much will I be involved in choosing fonts and colors, etc.?

![fonts and colors](/images/blog/how-to-choose-a-web-developer/mika-baumeister-2X6bkiL0GDo-unsplash_comp.jpeg)

You should have some say in the design. The developer will not listen to every suggestion you make, but they should be open to most of them. If you’re making a website for your company, it makes sense that you would want the site to be consistent with your brand.

You shouldn’t feel like you need to pick out every font and color yourself, though; that’s where their expertise comes in.

## Think about these questions when choosing your web developer.

![questions](/images/blog/how-to-choose-a-web-developer/pexels-olya-kobruseva-5428836_comp.jpeg)

Choosing the right web developer is one of the most important decisions you'll make in this process. While it's tempting to hire someone who can do everything for you, that may not be the best choice. You need to find a web developer who has experience in building websites, but also has knowledge of other areas like SEO and content management systems (CMS).

This list of questions will help you determine if a particular web developer is right for your project:

- Does he or she have experience with ecommerce sites? (If not, consider hiring a team that does.)
- Are they knowledgeable about designing responsive sites (sites that work well across all devices)?
- Can they provide references from previous clients? If so, how was their service? What did the client say about them specifically?

How long has the web developer been in business? Do they have a portfolio of websites that they've built? If so, are these websites responsive or designed for specific devices? How does your site compare to theirs in terms of design and functionality?

## Conclusion

I hope this guide has helped you get started in your search for the perfect web developer. Remember that there are no hard and fast rules when it comes to choosing someone for this job, but having a checklist of questions like these can help make sure that both parties know what they’re getting into and will be happy with the outcome.
