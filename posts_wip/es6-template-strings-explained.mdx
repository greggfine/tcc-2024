In this article, we'll learn about the [template string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) feature introduced in **ES6**.

<br />

A **template string** is structured as follows:

<SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript">{`var firstName = “Gregg”;
\`My name is \${firstName}.\``}</SyntaxHighlighter>

There are two things to take notice of here:

- We use back-ticks `` to enclose the template string(as opposed to traditional single or double quotes).
- We use the dollar symbol followed by curly brackets (also referred to as a **placeholder**).
  Variables or expressions placed within these curly brackets will be evaluated.

As we can see, one of the benefits of **template strings** is that they allow us to interpolate strings with variables and expressions in a cleaner, more elegant manner.

In this way, they add a bit of [syntactic sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar) to our code.

<br />

Let’s start with a comparison between the traditional approach to string interpolation and the newer template string approach:

<SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript">
  {`
var color = “blue”;
console.log("My favorite color is " + color + “.");
	`}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

This results in: **My favorite color is blue**.

<br />

A few things that make this traditional approach feel clunky are:

- Whenever we interpolate a variable, we need to continually open and close our string with quotes and then add on that variable with the plus operator.
- Also, using spaces and punctuation marks feels a bit awkward. In the above example, we had to remember to add a space after the word “is” and then use another pair of double quotes just to get that period in at the end.

So, we can say that this traditional approach is a bit difficult to read and a bit difficult to grok.

Now, let’s contrast this with the newer template string approach:

<SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript">
  {`
var color = “blue”;
	`}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

In my opinion, template strings are easier to write and understand. We only need to think about two things: the overall string enclosed in back-ticks and whatever variables(or expressions) we want to interpolate.

## Multiline Strings

Another place where template strings are beneficial is when working with multiline strings.

Traditionally, getting part of a string to appear on a new line requires using the newline character: \n.

For example, to make the word “blue” appear on a new line would require:

console.log(“My favorite color is \nblue.”)

Now, however, the newline character isn't necessary to create a line break.

All we need to do is write:

<SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript">
  {`
    `}

</SyntaxHighlighter>
