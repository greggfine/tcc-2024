## Introduction

In this post, you'll learn four aspects of basic styling in [**Svelte**](https://svelte.dev/):
scoped styles, global styles, the Style directive, and the Class directive.

## Scoped Styles

Straight out the gate, when you write styles within a pair of style tags in a **.Svelte** file, those styles are scoped to the component.

This means if we set a color of ‚Äúred‚Äù for an **h1** in one component, an **h1** in a different component won't be affected.

Essentially, each component's **CSS** is isolated from other components' **CSS**.

How is this scoping accomplished?: **Svelte** generates unique class names during compilation to ensure conflicts are avoided.

## Global Styles

Of course, **Svelte** doesn't limit us to scoped styles.

We can also create global styles via a couple of methods.

The first method is to create a global stylesheet. (**global.css**, for example).

We can then import this stylesheet into a layout file (**\_\_layout.svelte**) within a pair of script tags.

```js
<script>import '$lib/styles/global.css';</script>
```

Svelte also gives us the **global modifier** allowing us to opt out of
the default scoping behavior.

And we can do so for any given rule.
For example:

```js
:global(h1){
  color: red;
}
```

## The Style Directive

One of the great things about working with a reactive framework like **Svelte** is that we can dynamically set values for **CSS** styles.

Look at this example where we set the **CSS** <Syntax>color</Syntax> property to a variable.
(We've named the variable <Syntax>myColor</Syntax>).

```js
<script>
  let myColor = "red";
</script>

<h1 style:color={myColor}>Hello</h1>
```

What's the benefit of setting the value this way?: that variable can be changed dynamically.

For example, let's add a button element with an <Syntax>on:click</Syntax> directive.
(_<Syntax>on:click</Syntax> is the equivalent of using the [**addEventListener**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) method with <Syntax>click</Syntax> as the event type_).

When that button is clicked, we'll invoke a function called <Syntax>changeColor</Syntax>.

This function will re-assign the <Syntax>myColor</Syntax> variable to ‚Äúorange.‚Äù

```js
<script>
  let myColor = 'red';
  function changeColor() {
    myColor = "orange"	;
  }
</script>
<h1 style:color={myColor}>Hello</h1>
<button on:click={changeColor}>Change Color</button>
```

Although this is a contrived example, the concept should be apparent.

Since **Svelte's** overarching philosophy leans towards simplicity, we get a nice shorthand we can use when the **CSS** property name is the same as the variable name.

If, for example, we named our variable <Syntax>color</Syntax>, instead of <Syntax>myColor</Syntax>, we can make our code more terse:

```js
<script>
  let color = 'red';
  function changeColor() {
    color = "orange"	;
  }
</script>
<h1 style:color>Hello</h1>
<button on:click={changeColor}>Change Color</button>
```

What's not to love? üòç

And what about a situation where we need to set multiple styles?

```js
<script>
  let color = 'red';
  let fontSize = '64px';
</script>

<h1 style:color style:font-size={fontSize}>Hello</h1>

```

## The Class Directive

Setting dynamic classes on elements is basically the same as using <Syntax>style:property</Syntax>.

Here's an example where we set a class called <Syntax>active</Syntax> equal to the value of a variable called <Syntax>active</Syntax>:

```js
<script>
  let active = true;
</script>
<h1 class:active={active}>Hello</h1>
```

Notice that we are setting that <Syntax>active</Syntax> variable to a boolean value.

So, using the <Syntax>class:name</Syntax> directive is a perfect way to toggle classes on or off.

You might've noticed that our class name (<Syntax>active</Syntax>) is the same as our variable name.

As with <Syntax>style:property</Syntax>, we can use the shorthand and omit everything after the class name:

```js
<script>
  let active = true;
</script>
<h1 class:active>Hello</h1>
```

## Conditional Styling

To finish off our exploration of basic styling in **Svelte**, let's look at a common scenario for toggling a class on or off based on the state of a variable.

We can use a [**ternary operator**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator) directly inline to achieve this:

```js
<script>
  let active = true;
</script>
<h1 class:active={active? active : ''}>Hello</h1>
```

This can also be shortened to:

```js
<script>
  let active = true;
</script>
<h1 class:active={active}>Hello</h1>

```

And, of course, we can flip the state of that <Syntax>active</Syntax> variable from true to false and vice versa via a user interaction like a button click, for example.
